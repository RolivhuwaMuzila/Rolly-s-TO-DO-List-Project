# 📋 Rolly's To-Do List Project

## 📌 Overview
This **To-Do List** application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, remove them, and organize tasks into categories. The application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the front end, with **Node.js** handling server-side functionality. Data is stored in local storage to ensure tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

- ❌ **Remove/Delete Tasks**: Easily delete tasks you no longer need.
- ✅ **Mark Complete**: Mark tasks as complete to keep track of progress.
- 📂 **Categories**: Organize tasks into different categories for better management.
- 🌞🌜 **Day/Night Mode**: Switch between day and night modes using the sun/moon emoji button.
- 📐 **Resizable To-Do List**: Easily resize the to-do list interface by dragging the bottom-right corner.
- 💾 **Data Persistence**: All tasks are saved in local storage, ensuring data is not lost on page reload.

## 💻 Technologies Used

## 🛠️ How It Works
When you access the **To-Do List** application:

1. **Welcome Screen**: 
   - You'll see a **To-Do List heading** along with a greeting on the left side.
   - The **current date and time** are displayed, accompanied by motivational quotes.

2. **Day/Night Mode**: 
   - In the top-right corner, there’s a **sun/moon emoji** 🌞🌜. Click it to toggle between day and night modes.

3. **Adding a Task**:
   - Click the **"+" button** to add a new task.
   - Enter your **task name**.
   - **Select a category** (e.g., Work, Personal, Health).
   - **Choose a priority** level (High, Medium, Low).
   - Set a **due date** for your task.
   - Finally, click the **"Add" button** to save your task.

4. **Viewing Tasks by Category**:
   - To view your tasks, navigate to the specific **category** you chose when adding the task.
   - Tasks will be displayed in this format:
     ```
     Task: Read Bible  
     Priority: High  
     Due Date: 16/11/2024
     ```

5. **Deleting and Completing Tasks**:
   - To delete a task, click the **small delete button** next to it.
   - Once a task is done, click the **checkbox** to mark it as complete.
   - ⚠️ **Note**: You cannot edit a task once it’s added. If changes are needed, you’ll have to delete it and create a new one.

6. **Resizable Interface**:
   - You can **resize** the to-do list interface by dragging from the **bottom-right corner** to adjust its size according to your preference.

## 🚀 Usage
