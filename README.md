📋 Rolly's To-Do List Project
📌 Overview
This To-Do List application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, remove them, and organize tasks into categories. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, with Node.js handling server-side functionality. Data is stored in local storage to ensure tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

✨ Features
📝 Add Tasks: Users can input new tasks, assign categories, set priority levels, and due dates.
❌ Remove/Delete Tasks: Easily delete tasks you no longer need.
✅ Mark Complete: Mark tasks as complete to keep track of progress.
📂 Categories: Organize tasks into different categories for better management.
🌞🌜 Day/Night Mode: Switch between day and night modes using the sun/moon emoji button.
💾 Data Persistence: All tasks are saved in local storage, ensuring data is not lost on page reload.

🛠️ How It Works
When you access the To-Do List application:

Welcome Screen:

You'll see a To-Do List heading along with a greeting on the left side.
The current date and time are displayed, accompanied by motivational quotes.
Day/Night Mode:

In the top-right corner, there’s a sun/moon emoji 🌞🌜. Click it to toggle between day and night modes.
Adding a Task:

Click the "+" button to add a new task.
Enter your task name.
Select a category (e.g., Work, Personal, Health).
Choose a priority level (High, Medium, Low).
Set a due date for your task.
Finally, click the "Add" button to save your task.
Viewing Tasks by Category:

To view your tasks, navigate to the specific category you chose when adding the task.
Tasks will be displayed in this format:
Read Bible  
Priority: High  
Due Date: 16/11/2024
Deleting and Completing Tasks:

To delete a task, click the small delete button next to it.
Once a task is done, click the checkbox to mark it as complete.
⚠️ Note: You cannot edit a task once it’s added. If changes are needed, you’ll have to delete it and create a new one.
🚀 Usage
Adding a Task
Enter the task details as explained above.

💾 Local Storage
This application utilizes the browser's local storage to save tasks. This means that even if you refresh the page or close the browser, your tasks will still be available the next time you open the application.
